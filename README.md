# LibreMercado
It's a copy of Mercado Libre style, but for practice my skills.

After finishing the first part of the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp, I wanted to practice my web development skills. I thought, 
why not create a new project? I decided to make a website similar to Mercado Libre as a way to apply what I have learned.

The only rule in my project is don't use Bootstrap or frameworks. Only HTML, CSS and Sass, and Java Script Vainilla
